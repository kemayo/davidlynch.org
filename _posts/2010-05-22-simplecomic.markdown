Another new-ish release, this time a PHP webcomic content management system called [simplecomic](http://github.com/kemayo/simplecomic).

Features:

* Multiple comics per day
* Schedule posting of comics in advance
* Masking of comic filenames so scheduled comics can't be easily found
* Comic descriptions, alt text, and transcripts
* Optional chapter divisions for comics
* "Rants" as a lightweight blog, with scheduled posting
* Theme system
* Static pages
* Support for the frontpage showing the first comic from the most recent day with comics, to allow posting of "issues"

I wrote it for a friend who wanted to start her own webcomic and wasn't happy with the existing options in the field of webcomic CMSes.

You can see an example [here](http://acidreflux.ficwad.com/). It's a dead webcomic that I happen to be hosting for sentimental reasons. Ignore the Comic Sans... it's also there for sentimental reasons. :P

Get it [on github](http://github.com/kemayo/simplecomic).
