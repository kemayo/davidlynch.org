I _loathe_ having to watch a video or listen to audio to extract information, and would far prefer to read an article explaining the same information.

It's therefore unfortunate that most of the time when I want to find out how to do something nowadays, a google search will turn up almost-exclusively video results. Particularly as one gets into niche areas... ["minecraft iron golem farm"](https://www.google.com/search?q=minecraft+villager+farm) for example, seems like an area where some detailed diagrams would be vastly better than watching 30 minute videos.

I'm apparently a minority in holding this opinion. Drat.
