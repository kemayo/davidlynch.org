["Clickable Maps"](http://www.clickablemaps.com/) is selling pre-made maps explicitly for use with Maphilight.

The pre-purchase samples are pretty good examples of what's possible. This [USA map](http://www.clickablemaps.com/clickable-map-of-the-united-states-small/) shows remote triggering of a hilight, for instance.

Note: I wouldn't have released under the MIT license if this sort of thing bothered me.
