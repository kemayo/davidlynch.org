After resisting smartphones for many years, I got one a few months ago, just before I moved. It turns out that they're pretty nifty. Who knew, right?

I got an [LG Optimus V](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/lg-optimus-v-phone.jsp) on Virgin Mobile. One of the big things that had been stopping me from getting one before was that I couldn't quite bring myself to pay as much as you have to for a phone plan with data. Virgin Mobile gets around this objection by offering phone + unlimited data for $25/month... which is frankly insanely cheap compared to everyone else that I looked at.

It runs Android, and is pretty easy to root and flash to a newer version, which I have done. I held off on it for ages, but then my wife did it and I was impressed enough by CyanogenMOD to want to do it myself.

It's not a fancy phone; it has a smallish screen, and not a terribly powerful processor. But sufficient for my needs.

So, consider this recommended. If you're cheap like me. :)
