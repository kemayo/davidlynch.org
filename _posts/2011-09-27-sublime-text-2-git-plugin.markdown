I wrote [a git plugin](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki) for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

I'd decided to try Sublime out for work to see how it compared to TextMate... and thus some degree of git integration was required. Given that it's been out since January, I was surprised that there wasn't already a solid git plugin.

I did find [this one](https://github.com/notanumber/gitst2), admittedly, but I decided that I didn't like how it fit in with Sublime. It's built around menus and keybinds, whereas I felt that setting everything up as commands in the palette and hooking as much stuff as I could into the fuzzy search was the way to go.

Working on the plugin was a good exercise in getting me used to Sublime. I'm fairly sold on it as a result. It's philosophically somewhat similar to TextMate, but with some of TextMate's rough edges smoothed out.

(Short rant: if the [recently announced TextMate2 alpha](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/whats-next/) doesn't get rid of the single-character undo buffer... I don't know what I'll do. It's certainly the biggest single complaint I have about TextMate nowadays.)
