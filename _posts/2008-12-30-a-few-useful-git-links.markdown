I recently saw [one approach](http://log.damog.net/2008/12/two-git-tips/) to the "what git branch am I on?" issue, which (if you're using the bash shell) puts your current branch into your prompt.

There's also [tortoisegit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) for Windows. TortoiseSVN has always been one of the best things about SVN, so it's good to see a clone pop up for git.
