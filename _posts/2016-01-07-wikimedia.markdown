I [mentioned][wordpress-again] that I hadn't been updating this blog, and that wasn't just a matter of there being nothing to talk about.

Back in July I got laid off by DeviantArt. Since that was their second layoffs round of 2015, I think it's fair to say that they're having some _problems_.

This was non-ideal for me. In retrospect, I should probably have started looking around for a new job after the _first_ layoffs round, but I'll count that as a learning experience.

Fortunately, I then spent a month on downtime and relaxing, because I'd been terrible at taking vacation time at DeviantArt and they thus had to pay out a _lot_ of vacation hours to lay me off.

Now I'm [part of the Visual Editor team](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Staff_and_contractors#VisualEditor) at [the Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home). I help people edit Wikipedia, essentially.
