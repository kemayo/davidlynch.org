[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)'s API documentation is weirdly incomplete.

The [official function reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation), for instance, was last updated for WordPress 2.1, and we're now on 2.5.

This is making updating that widget I wrote be more of a hassle than I expected.
