It is possible that this blog's naming scheme could be construed as being a bit egotistical. I just want to reclaim my name from popular culture!

But enough of that. Who am I?

I'm a 23 year old who immigrated to the USA from England when I was 17. I possess many useful insights into the ways that Americans love [Received Pronunciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation). (The accent thing may come up more. I have *anecdotes*, I swear to dog.)

I'm a programmer. I think the first program I ever wrote was (from a tutorial) a calculator in Objective C on a NeXT cube -- a revelation that might possibly date me. I didn't really get into that, though, and it took the discovery of PHP to make me actually realize that, hey, I could actually write *useful* things. Since then I've moved on to Python and Lua as my languages of choice, and am dabbling in Ruby.

I play World of Warcraft. This rather ties into my previous point, since I'm fairly sure that I've spent more time [writing addons](/projects/wow/) than actually *playing*. It takes all sorts. Anyway, it's a thing I intend to talk about, so I disclose it here.

I recognize that this blending of topics makes this blog horribly unmarketable, and I am committing many a sin against recommended traffic-building practices here. Woe is me.
