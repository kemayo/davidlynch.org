[NautilusSVN](http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/) is a TortoiseSVN clone for the GNOME file browser, Nautilus.

I am very happy to have found this. Now, I just need someone to write "NautilusGit". (Or wait for the NautilusSVN project to do what they say they plan to, and extend it to cover multiple VCSs...)
