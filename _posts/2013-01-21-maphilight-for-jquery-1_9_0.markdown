jQuery 1.9 was [released][jq19release] recently, and removed [some things][jq19upgrade] that have long been labeled as deprecated. This broke maphilight slightly, since it was still doing a few checks on `$.browser`.

I've just fixed that. As always, [the latest version is available on github][maphub].
