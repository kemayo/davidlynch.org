I've been running [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) on my home computer for a week and a half now. That's right, I've [joined the "A-list blogger circle-jerk"](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/17/of-canaries-and-coal-mines). For certain values of "A". Specifically, the value "F".

I've mostly found alternatives for all the programs I used. The only area where I'm not quite satisfied is a music player; I used [foobar2000](http://foobar2000.org/) on Windows, and I haven't found one to match it yet. (I've settled on [Quod Libet](http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet) at the moment, though its UI is a bit lacking.)

[WoW works](http://wowwiki.com/Linux/Wine), but I seem to be paying a ~10fps tax for running it under Wine. It's a pain, but it's still playable.

I still have XP on a partition, but I haven't yet run into anything I need to boot into it for. This is a promising development.

I'm looking forward to Hardy Heron's release. It'll come with the newer nvidia drivers, which [apparently](http://ventnorsblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/magic-169.html) [improve performance](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=934&num=1). This will be appreciated, as I've been unimpressed by canvas in Linux-Firefox so far.
