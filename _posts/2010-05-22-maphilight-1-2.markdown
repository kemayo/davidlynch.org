I finally got around to [officially releasing maphilight 1.2](http://plugins.jquery.com/node/1837/release).

This mostly just updates the official jquery.com release to the HEAD of [the github project](http://github.com/kemayo/maphilight/).

I'd been putting it off because I spent quite a while without easy access to a Windows machine with IE8 to test the fixes that people provided. But I switched back to Windows as my main desktop recently (mainly to play games), so that was resolved.

There's not much in the way of changes:

* IE8 works now
* New "neverOn" option for use with metadata by Zach Dennis, which stops individual areas from ever being hilighted
* Handles being called on the same area twice differently; now rebuilds the hilighted regions
* ...and I added [an example](http://davidlynch.org/js/maphilight/docs/demo_simple.html) of triggering the hilight from another element, since it's one of the most commonly asked questions

Hopefully I'll be able to post here a bit more now that I have some of that guilt for not updating off my shoulders. :P
