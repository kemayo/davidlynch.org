I released [maphilight 1.3](http://plugins.jquery.com/content/maphilight-13) just now. (Though really I consider [github](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight) the more authoritative source.)

So, IE9 broke maphilight because it was finally exposing the has_canvas codepath to IE. Turns out all the canvas stuff worked beautifully, but one call to setTimeout was relying on a non-IE feature. So that's fixed!

Also changed since the 1.2 release (one year ago, gosh):

* New option groupBy lets you bundle several areas together
* New option wrapClass lets you set a classname for the wrapper div created to hold the canvas elements used by maphilight. If it's set to `true` it'll use the classname from the image.
* .data('maphilight') is checked for areas, as well as the metadata plugin. With jQuery > 1.4.3 this means that you can use JSON in an HTML5 data- attribute to pass this in. See [the API docs](http://api.jquery.com/data/) for details.
* Performance on image maps containing a lot of areas was terrible because I [was stupid about where I triggered an event](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight/commit/acb9d4b1df8a75da221982f86c34193a5470b6b8).
* Opera compatibility was harmed by [jQuery bug #6708](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6708) (fixed in 1.6), so work around that.
