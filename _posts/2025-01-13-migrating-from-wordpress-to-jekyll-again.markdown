There's been a lot of [drama with WordPress][drama] lately, and the way Matt has been behaving has left me less than confident about having this blog using WordPress. Particularly not with automatic updates turned on. As such, I decided to move this back to Jekyll. Goodbye comments, once more.

My [original reason][original] for returning to WordPress was that the workflow for updating jekyll was much less user-friendly. But these days, particularly with Gutenberg being so awkward to use, I don't really feel there's much of a practical difference. I won't be able to update this when I'm away from a real computer... but I wasn't doing that anway.

Who knows, maybe I'll post more than once a year again?

...or procrastinate about that until we get a "migrating to Hugo" post. ðŸ¤”
